## Project:
### 1. Global Top Three Pharmaceutical Company: 
**Objective**: Assist clients in estimating the contribution of each marketing strategy, encompassing the impact at various hierarchical levels.  
We primarily utilize the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to establish Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) models, aiding each client in identifying the contribution of every marketing strategy. Since it's challenging to measure the impact of each strategy with just the cost information, we employ the MMM model to calculate response curves for each marketing strategy. This allows us to determine the incremental benefits of investing one more dollar. Subsequently, we compute the optimal budget allocation, supporting client decision-making. This approach has helped clients save $30 million in budget without compromising their revenue.

### 2. Top Three Advertising Companies:
**Objective**: Optimize next month's budget allocation across various advertising channels.  
This is a digital advertising case with exceptionally granular client data. We provide optimization solutions at various levels. Our primary approach involves using XGBoost to build MMM models for each advertising channel, facilitating upper management decision-making and achieving a 10% revenue increase simultaneously.

### 3. Global Steel and Aerospace Company:
**Objective**: Accurately predict the number of orders for the next month across 20 categories.  
This is a supply chain forecasting case where I utilized Autotuning in conjunction with Backtesting to train various ML models, including RF and DeepAR. By identifying the top-performing model out of 20 different combinations, we achieved a forecasting accuracy of 95%. This optimization led to significant cost savings in warehousing for the client, resulting in a remarkable 52% increase in net revenue.

## Product:
In the early stages, I independently utilized openCPU to create a backend API for rapid market trend testing.  
During the mid-term, I focused on product workflow and business model development, closely collaborating with the product team.  
In the later stages, I specialized in algorithm development, working with the data science team to create in-house algorithmic products.
